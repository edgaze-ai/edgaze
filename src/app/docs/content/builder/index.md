# Builder Documentation

Welcome to the Builder documentation! This comprehensive guide will help you master Edgaze's powerful builder tools and create professional AI products without writing code.

## What is the Builder?

The Builder is a collection of sophisticated visual tools that let you create AI products without writing code. There are two main builders, each designed for different use cases:

- **Workflow Studio** - Build complex AI workflows by connecting different AI blocks together. Create multi-step processes, handle conditions, make API calls, and process data through multiple stages.

- **Prompt Studio** - Create reusable prompts with customizable placeholders. Write your prompt once, define what information users need to provide, and publish it as a shareable product.

Both builders are designed to be intuitive yet powerful, allowing you to create professional AI products that can be shared, sold, or used privately.

## Getting Started

Choose the builder that fits your needs:

### Workflow Studio

Workflow Studio lets you create multi-step AI workflows by connecting different blocks (called "nodes") together. Each node performs a specific task, and you connect them to create a complete workflow that can handle complex processes.

**Use Workflow Studio when you want to:**
- Create complex multi-step AI processes
- Combine multiple AI models or services
- Build workflows that process data through multiple stages
- Create conditional logic in your AI applications
- Make HTTP requests to external APIs
- Process arrays and loops
- Handle errors and retries
- Create sophisticated data transformations

**Perfect for:**
- Content generation pipelines
- Data processing workflows
- Multi-model AI applications
- API integrations
- Complex business logic
- Automated processes

### Prompt Studio

Prompt Studio helps you create reusable prompts with placeholders. You write your prompt once, define what information users need to provide, and then publish it as a shareable product that others can use.

**Use Prompt Studio when you want to:**
- Create reusable prompts with customizable inputs
- Build prompt templates for specific use cases
- Share prompts with others through a simple interface
- Create prompts that adapt based on user input
- Publish prompts to the marketplace
- Create prompt libraries

**Perfect for:**
- Content writing prompts
- Analysis templates
- Translation prompts
- Question-answering templates
- Format conversion prompts
- Specialized domain prompts
