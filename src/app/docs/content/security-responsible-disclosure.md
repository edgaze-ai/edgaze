1. Purpose of This Policy

This Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy (“Policy”) outlines how security vulnerabilities, potential security issues, or bugs related to the Edgaze platform (the “Platform”) may be reported.

This Policy is intended to:
- Encourage responsible disclosure of issues
- Centralize reporting through approved channels
- Reduce legal, operational, and reputational risk
- Protect the Platform, its users, and third parties

Edgaze is not obligated to implement, maintain, or operate a formal security or bug management program.

2. Scope

This Policy applies to:
- The Edgaze platform and associated services
- Infrastructure, APIs, and interfaces operated by Edgaze
- Bugs, errors, vulnerabilities, or unexpected behavior discovered during normal, lawful use of the Platform

This Policy does not apply to third-party services or dependencies not controlled by Edgaze.

3. Reporting Security Issues and Bugs

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, bug, or potential issue affecting the Platform, you may report it using one of the following approved channels:

- Email: security@edgaze.ai  
- Help Page: Bug or issue submission through the Edgaze help or support interface, where available

Reports should include, where reasonably possible:
- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce or observe the issue
- Any relevant technical details

Incomplete or unclear reports may not be reviewed or processed.

4. Responsible Disclosure Expectations

When reporting an issue, you agree to:
- Act in good faith
- Avoid exploiting the issue
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or extracting data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Avoid disrupting the Platform or other users
- Avoid public disclosure of the issue prior to Edgaze addressing it, if at all

Edgaze does not consent to testing or reporting methods that violate applicable law, the Terms of Service, or other platform policies.

---

5. No Bug Bounty or Compensation

Edgaze does not offer:
- Bug bounties
- Monetary rewards
- Credits, discounts, or benefits

Submission of a report does not create any entitlement, contract, or obligation.

6. No Guarantee of Response or Remediation

Edgaze makes no guarantees regarding:
- Acknowledgment of reports
- Response time
- Investigation, validation, or prioritization
- Fixes, mitigations, or remediation

Any response or action taken is at Edgaze’s sole discretion.
