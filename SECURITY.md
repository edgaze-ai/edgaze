# Security policy

Edgaze takes security seriously. This document describes our supported versions and how to report vulnerabilities.

---

## Supported versions

We provide security updates for the current major version. Backports to the previous major version are made when feasible.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you have discovered a security issue in Edgaze:

1. **Contact** the maintainers through your team’s designated security channel (e.g. email or private advisory).
2. **Include** a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact.
3. **Allow** a reasonable time for a fix before any public disclosure.

We will acknowledge receipt promptly and work with you to understand and address the issue. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

---

## Our process

- **Critical issues** are prioritized and patched as soon as possible.
- **Fixes** are released in a new version and documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Disclosure** of vulnerability details occurs only after a fix is available, unless otherwise required by law or agreed with the reporter.

Thank you for helping keep Edgaze secure.
